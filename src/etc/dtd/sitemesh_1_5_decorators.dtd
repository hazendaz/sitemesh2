DTD Version: 1.5

This is the DTD for the SiteMesh 1.5 decorator.xml file.

It's style and order are based on the web.xml DTD file
listed in the Servlet 2.3 specification. This means that
the declaration of decorators and mappings follows the same
format as servlets / servlet mappings or filters / filter
mappings.

Valid decorator.xml files must contain the following DOCTYPE
declaration

<!DOCTYPE decorators PUBLIC "-//OpenSymphony//SiteMesh 1.5 Decorators//EN" "http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/dtd/sitemesh_1_5_decorators.dtd">
