<!--
    This file is only used because the default charset is '8859-1'  As utf-8 is a superset, we choose this as a default.

    For other servers, we can use a servlet filter to set the charset in the page.  However, a bug in weblogic prevents this.

    Change the charset below if you wish to use a character set other than utf-8 in weblogic
