<!-- This file is only used because the default charset is '8859-1'  As utf-8 is a superset, we choose this as a default.

    For other servers, we can use a servlet filter to set the charset in the page.  However, a bug in orion prevents this:
    http://bugzilla.orionserver.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=347

    Change the charset below if you wish to use a character set other than utf-8 in orion
-->
